# Hi, I'm  Maleyka! ðŸ‘‹

Finally, now I have time to build my portfolio in GitHub. It is in the process...

## ðŸš€ About Me
I have graduated from my master's in Cologne University of Applied Sciences,Germany with Data Science
focus. 
I'm a Data Scientist/Ml engineer, passionate about uncovering insights from large datasets,
building predictive models and using data to solve real-world problems.
I have worked several AI/Data Science projects in Germany both national and international
level, and did extensive research and experimentation during my master thesis in ML/DL 
algorithms and both standard & advanced augmentation techniques(transformer and CNN based GANs).
Soon all codes from the projects I have worked on will be available 
in my GitHub with a nice Read.me files.
