### Hi, I'm  Maleyka! ðŸ‘‹  
Here is my ([resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v7IPV-DtYACNnUsowQKhOIvpNkbijQOO/view?usp=sharing))

I am building my portfolio on GitHub. It is in progress...
I'm excited to share that all code for the projects I have worked on will soon be uploaded here,
complete with Readme files to guide you through each one.

#### ðŸ‘¤About Me
I earned my master's degree from Cologne University of Applied Sciences in Germany, with a focus on Data Science.
Having engaged in various high-impact Data Science projects across Germany, I bring international experience and a keen eye for data exploration, 
preparation and analytical strategy formulation. My hands-on work during my master's thesis familiarized me with a spectrum of ML/DL algorithms, emphasizing both conventional and advanced data augmentation techniques, such as transformer models and CNN-based GANs.
As I transition more towards data analysis and data engineering, I leverage my skills to craft data-driven solutions and optimize data workflows, turning complex data into strategic assets and bridging data science with robust engineering for real-world impact.
