# Hi, I'm  Maleyka! ðŸ‘‹

Finally, now I have time to build my portfolio on GitHub. It is in the process...

## About Me
I graduated from my master's degree at Cologne University of Applied Sciences (Germany) with a Data Science
focus. 
I'm a Data Scientist/ML engineer, passionate about uncovering insights from large datasets,
building predictive models and using data to solve real-world problems.
I have worked on various Data Science projects in Germany, both at national and international
level and conducted extensive research and experimentation during my master's thesis in ML/DL 
algorithms, both standard & advanced augmentation techniques,  including transformer and CNN-based GANs.

ðŸ“š Research & Publications & Upcoming Endeavors

- Writing a research paper for the HEALTHINF conference in Rome, Italy, 2024.
- Preparing for the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam this September.

ðŸ”— What's onn My GitHub?
- I'm excited to share that all code from my various projects, including my Master's thesis, will soon be accessible here,
complete with Readme files to guide you through each one.
