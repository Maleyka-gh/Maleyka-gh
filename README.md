# Hi, I'm  Maleyka! ðŸ‘‹

Finally, now I have time to build my portfolio on GitHub. It is in the process...

## ðŸš€ About Me
I graduated from my master's degree at Cologne University of Applied Sciences (Germany) with a Data Science
focus. 
I'm a Data Scientist/ML engineer, passionate about uncovering insights from large datasets,
building predictive models and using data to solve real-world problems.
I have worked on various AI/Data Science projects in Germany, both at a national and international
level, and did extensive research and experimentation during my master's thesis in ML/DL 
algorithms, both standard & advanced augmentation techniques,  including transformer and CNN-based GANs.
I'm excited to share that all the code from my projects will soon be accessible with the Readme files on my GitHub.

I'm preparing for the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam this September and writing a paper based on my master's thesis  for the HEALTHINF conference in Rome, Italy, in 2024.
