# Hi, I'm  Maleyka! ðŸ‘‹

Finally, now I have time to build my portfolio on GitHub. It is in the process...

## ðŸš€ About Me
I graduated from my master's degree at Cologne University of Applied Sciences (Germany) with a Data Science
focus. 
I'm a Data Scientist/ML engineer, passionate about uncovering insights from large datasets,
building predictive models and using data to solve real-world problems.
I have worked on several AI/Data Science projects in Germany, both national and international
level, and did extensive research and experimentation during my master's thesis in ML/DL 
algorithms and both standard & advanced augmentation techniques(transformer and CNN-based GANs).
Soon, all codes from the projects I have worked on will be available 
in my GitHub with nice Readme files. 

I am preparing for  the AWS Cloud Practitioner Examination in September.
