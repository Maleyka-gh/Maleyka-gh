### Hi, I'm  Maleyka! ðŸ‘‹

I am building my portfolio on GitHub. It is in progress...
I'm excited to share that all code for the projects I have worked on, including my Master's thesis, will soon be accessible here,
complete with Readme files to guide you through each one.

#### ðŸ‘¤About Me
I earned my master's degree from Cologne University of Applied Sciences in Germany, with a focus on Data Science.
I'm a Data Scientist/ML engineer based in Germany, passionate about transforming large datasets
into actionable insights and building predictive models to address real-world problems.
I have worked on various Data Science projects in Germany, both at national and international
level and conducted extensive research and experimentation during my master's thesis in ML/DL 
algorithms, both standard & advanced augmentation techniques,  including transformer and CNN-based GANs.
